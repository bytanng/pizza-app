Project Title: SliceMeUp - A web app for ordering authentic Italian pizza.

Background & Objective:

This project focuses on the development of a user-friendly web application tailored for pizza 
catering service. The core objective is to provide an efficient and convenient platform for customers to order pizzas online.

Upon visiting the website, clear and engaging photos are shown on the homepage to introduce the pizza restaurant, encouraging users to explore further.  On the menu tab, customers will have access to a visually appealing menu showcasing a variety of pizza options. Users will have to sign up and login before they can add an item to cart. They can then browse through these options and place orders effortlessly through the intuitive interface. Once an order is finalised, the user will be prompted to check out, and the web application will promptly acknowledge the order, following which, customers will receive automatic confirmation via email. 

Additionally, the portal will feature a customer feedback mechanism. This will enable customers to share their experience, and provide valuable suggestions for improvement.

In summary, this project aims to enhance the pizza catering experience by offering a streamlined online ordering system and a platform for customer engagement and feedback.
